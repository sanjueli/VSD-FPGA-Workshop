## FPGAs - Fabric, Design and Architecture
**The workshop was conducted by VLSI System Design â€“ Intelligent Assessment Technology (VSD-IAT) from 23-27 March' 2022 worldwide in online remote access mode.** 

**The training team was led by Kunal Ghosh.**

Each participant had a login portal where access was provided to video resources for each day. Access was provided to the design tools through a remote access login (Lab Instance) to a server. Asssessments included submission of tasks on a daily basis, along with MCQs based on various skillsets for each of the topics.

Daily online scheduled connects were held on Zoom for 30-60 min based on need. The collaboration was done 24x7 through a Slack Channel, where participants raised queries to be resolved by all including workshop mentors.

The workshop was spread over 5 days with the day-wise break up of topics as under:
+ Module 1
  + FPGA Introduction
  + Design of a 4-bit counter through Vivado on Basys3 FPGA
  + Use of Virtual Input/Output (VIO)
+ Module 2
  + OpenFPGA Introduction
  + VTR Flow Process
  + Demos 
    + VPR flow: tseng on Earch
    + VTR flow: 4 bit counter on Earch
    + Timing, area, power and post implementation simulation
    + Basys3 vs VTR results
 + Module 3:
   + Explain RISC-V RVMyth processor code
   + Run it till bitstream on Basys3
 + Module 4:
   + Skywater OpenSource FPGA (SOFA): 4-bit counter on SOFA
   + Area, timing and post implementation
 + Module 5:
   + Skywater OpenSource FPGA (SOFA): RVMyth on SOFA 
   + Area, timing and post implementation
